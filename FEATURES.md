- [x] GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN - Signal handling for clean Ctrl+C termination.
- [ ] AOF - Append Only File for real-time data safety.
- [ ] SCHEDULED BACKUP - Save a backup every x time to prevent data loss.
- [ ] OS SIGNALS - Handle SIGTERM and other signals to save data before exiting.

## Protocol & Networking
